**Moderat** is a web-based Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) automation platform designed to simplify compliance management for small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs), public/state agencies, and organizations with critical infrastructure. It provides research-backed, personalized compliance plans to implement international and national standards (e.g., ISO 27001, GDPR, NIS2, Armenian laws) while streamlining audit processes. Initially focused on the Armenian market, Moderat aims to expand to post-Soviet and EU markets with localized, user-centric solutions.
